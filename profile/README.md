# The Research Ecosystem Framework (REECO)
_A way to collect, manage, and present outputs of collaborative research projects._


The Research Ecosystem Framework (REECO) applies fair data management best practices to support collaborative research projects in the collection and curation of metadata of data and software assets. 

REECO generalises methods and software developed by the Data Management Plan (DMP) and Technical Board (TB) teams of the EU-funded project ["Polifonia - a digital harmonised of musical heritage knowledge"](http://www.polifonia-project.eu).  

The framework includes an Annotation Schema, a tool for validating annotations, Github integrated workflows to build a Website and associated Knowledge Graph. The tools link to well-established frameworks such as [Zenodo](http://zenodo.eu) and [Schema.org](http://schema.org). 

REECO meet the needs of large collaborative research projects in categorissing, classifying, and delivering project outputs in a coherent, unified way and, at the same time, ensure that the delivery is compliant with FAIR good practives and maximisies dissemination and potential for reuse, building on top of well-established framworks such as Github, Zenodo, and Schema.org.
